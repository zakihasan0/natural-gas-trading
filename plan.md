Project skeleton:
Add the directories outlined in the template (e.g. src/data_ingestion, src/strategies, tests/unit, etc.).
Set up Python environment:
Decide on poetry vs. pip vs. conda.
Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml plus an environment.yml for HPC.
Milestone: The repo is ready with all empty folders + basic .gitignore.

2. Core Tooling & Workflow

Pre-Commit Hooks (.pre-commit-config.yaml):
Install pre-commit.
Configure hooks: black/flake8/isort, or any other format/lint checks.
pre-commit install for local usage.
CI/CD:
Create .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
Actions: run tests (pytest), check coverage, lint.
Configure code coverage reporting (e.g. Codecov) if desired.
Milestone: Every push triggers a build + test run. Devs can’t merge broken code.

3. Data Ingestion & Processing

Data Ingestion:
Implement separate modules in src/data_ingestion/:
eia_fetcher.py: wraps EIA API calls.
weather_fetcher.py: NOAA or alternative weather data.
futures_fetcher.py: CME data scraping or API if available.
Output raw files into data/raw/.
Orchestration:
If using Airflow (or Prefect):
Create a DAG (dags/data_pipeline_dag.py).
Daily or weekly runs to fetch data, store it in data/raw.
Data Processing:
src/data_processing/cleaning.py & src/data_processing/transformations.py:
Clean missing data, convert datatypes, unify date formats.
If storing in a DB, define insertion logic. Otherwise CSV/Parquet in data/processed/.
Possibly track data in DVC if it’s large.
Milestone: Automated pipeline that fetches fresh data, cleans it, and writes a processed dataset.

4. Analytics & Factor Research

Analytics Modules (src/analytics/):
factor_research.py: correlation, feature importance, etc.
advanced_stats.py: advanced metrics—rolling volatility, seasonality analysis, distribution fit.
Notebooks:
notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb: initial data analysis, sanity checks.
notebooks/02_factor_research.ipynb: factor analysis, potential alpha signals.
Keep them read-only for final results, but do real logic in Python modules for reusability.
Milestone: You can see top features/factors driving NG price movements.

5. Strategy Implementation

Alpha Model (src/strategies/alpha_model.py):
Start with straightforward signals: momentum, mean reversion, fundamental supply/demand triggers.
Provide a standardized interface: e.g., generate_alpha_signals(df) -> pd.Series.
Risk Model (src/strategies/risk_model.py):
Stop-loss logic, position sizing constraints, max daily VaR, etc.
Portfolio Construction (src/strategies/portfolio_construction.py):
Combine alpha signals + risk constraints to produce final target weights or position sizes.
Possibly a standard function: construct_portfolio(signals, risk_params) -> allocations.
Milestone: Modular, testable strategy components.

6. Backtesting Engine

VectorBT Runner (src/backtesting/vectorbt_runner.py):
Set up a pipeline that loads data from data/processed/, runs alpha/risk, and uses vectorbt for simulation.
Store results in a standardized location, e.g. data/backtest_results/.
Custom Runner (optional):
If you need advanced fill simulations, slippage models, etc., wrap your own backtesting logic.
Provide a performance summary: Sharpe, drawdown, etc.
Performance Module (src/backtesting/performance.py):
Evaluate results: hit ratio, daily PnL, etc.
Milestone: You can run a single command (or script) to do an E2E backtest from processed data -> strategy signals -> performance metrics.

7. Live Trading Setup

Broker Integration (src/live_trading/broker_integration.py):
Connect to Interactive Brokers, CQG, or other.
Mock these calls in tests to avoid messing with real money every time.
Order Manager (src/live_trading/order_manager.py):
Send/modify/cancel orders.
Log everything.
Risk Monitor (src/live_trading/risk_monitor.py):
Real-time checks on margin usage, position limits, etc.
Milestone: Once a strategy is tested, you can flip the switch to go live with real order flow.

8. Testing & QA

Unit Tests:
tests/unit/test_data_ingestion.py: mock API calls, ensure data is properly formatted.
tests/unit/test_strategies.py: test alpha signals with known dataset.
Integration Tests:
tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py: run a small pipeline from data ingestion -> processing -> backtest on a short timeframe.
Regression Tests:
tests/regression/test_regression_scenarios.py: verify performance metrics remain above certain thresholds after code changes.
CI:
All tests run automatically on push/PR.
Coverage thresholds enforced (e.g., >80%).
Milestone: Strict code quality. No merges unless everything passes.

9. Deployment & Scaling

Docker:
Dockerfile to containerize.
docker-compose.yml to orchestrate Airflow, DB, etc.
Kubernetes or HPC:
If you need massive parallel backtests, either spin up HPC jobs or use a K8s cluster.
Production:
Potentially spin up an EC2/ECS instance that runs your live trading engine 24/7.
Milestone: The system can be deployed in a consistent environment for both dev and prod.

10. Documentation & Handoff

docs/architecture.md:
High-level diagrams of how each module interacts, pipeline flows, dependencies.
docs/usage.md:
Dev instructions, environment setup, run commands, API references.
README.md:
Keep it short—just enough so newcomers know what’s up.
Milestone: A fully documented codebase that can be maintained or handed off without guesswork.

Conclusion
Follow these steps in order. Each milestone ensures your dev has a clear target. By the end, you’ll have a robust “quant-grade” natural gas trading pipeline, from ingestion to live execution.

No half-measures. Commit to each phase properly before moving on. Now get to it.
